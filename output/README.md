# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Output folder

Three-Happy-Moments & Data Story: Please refer to the end of the project1.rmd file for details on the three happy moments and the data story.

Output: The rendered outputs of the analyses for the five sub-age groups can be found in the output directory as HTML files.

Note on Word Cloud: If you execute the entire project1.rmd file, you might observe a different word cloud on your local machine. This is because wordcloud2 generates images with an element of randomness each time it runs.
